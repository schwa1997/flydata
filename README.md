# FLYDATA - Graph Databases Course - Prof. Gianmaria Silvello

## University of Padova - COMPUTING ENGINEERING A.A. 2024-25

### Objective

Our project focuses on flight-related data, including flights, airlines, routes, airports, cities, countries, and flying conditions like weather. The goal is to model this data in a graph database to uncover insights, such as the impact of weather on flight punctuality and quantitative analysis of cities and routes.

### File Structure

#### Data Selection Folder

This folder contains the files related to the task 'Domain and Data Selection'.

Our group will decide on the open dataset(s) to model and process for the project. The submission should include a PDF file with the following information:

- Group name
- Component names
- URLs where the data is available
- A brief description of the domain of interest
- Reasons for selecting the domain for the project
- Main challenges related to the dataset
- Main characteristics of the selected dataset(s)
