### Objective

Our project focuses on flight-related data, including flights, airlines, routes, airports, cities, countries, and flying conditions like weather. The goal is to model this data in a graph database to uncover insights, such as the impact of weather on flight punctuality and quantitative analysis of cities and routes.
