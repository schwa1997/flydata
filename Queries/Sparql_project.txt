1. Shows for every manufacturer which models they produce and how many aircrafts per model there are:

####

prefix fly: <http://www.semanticweb.org/nele/ontologies/2024/10/flydata/>

select ?manufacturer_name ?model_name (COUNT(?aircraft) as ?nr_aircrafts) where {
    ?aircraft a fly:Aircraft ;
    		fly:hasModel ?model.
    ?model a fly:Model;
    		fly:name ?model_name;
    	fly:hasManufacturer ?manufacturer.
    ?manufacturer a fly:Manufacturer;
    		fly:name ?manufacturer_name.
} group by ?manufacturer_name ?model_name
order by ?manufacturer_name ?model_name

#####

2. Shows all the airports you can fly to from every departure airport:

####

prefix fly: <http://www.semanticweb.org/nele/ontologies/2024/10/flydata/>

select ?departure_airport ?arrival_airport where {
    ?dep a fly:Airport;
    			fly:name ?departure_airport.
    ?arr a fly:Airport;
    			fly:name ?arrival_airport.
    ?route a fly:Route;
    		fly:hasDepartureAirport ?dep;
    		fly:hasArrivalAirport ?arr.
} group by ?departure_airport ?arrival_airport

#######

3. Same as above but now with the number of flights that flew that specific route, ordered by descending number of flights:

######

prefix fly: <http://www.semanticweb.org/nele/ontologies/2024/10/flydata/>

select ?departure_airport ?arrival_airport (COUNT(?flight) as ?nr_flights) where {
    ?dep a fly:Airport;
    			fly:name ?departure_airport.
    ?arr a fly:Airport;
    			fly:name ?arrival_airport.
    ?route a fly:Route;
    		fly:hasDepartureAirport ?dep;
    		fly:hasArrivalAirport ?arr.
    ?flight a fly:Flight;
    		fly:hasRoute ?route.
    
} group by ?departure_airport ?arrival_airport
order by desc (?nr_flights)

#######

4.  Shows a state, a city and the number of airports in that city ordered by descending number of airports:

#####

prefix fly: <http://www.semanticweb.org/nele/ontologies/2024/10/flydata/>

select ?state ?city (COUNT(?air) as ?nr_airp) where {
    ?cty a fly:City;
    	fly:isLocatedInState ?st;
    	fly:name ?city.
    ?air a ?Airport;
            fly:isLocatedInCity ?cty.
    ?st a fly:State;
    	fly:name ?state.
}group by ?state ?city
order by desc (?nr_airp)

#########

5. number of airports per state with the total population of that state:

#######

prefix fly: <http://www.semanticweb.org/nele/ontologies/2024/10/flydata/>

select ?state (COUNT(?air) as ?nr_airp) (SUM(?pop) as ?total_population) where{
    ?cty a fly:City;
    	fly:isLocatedInState ?st;
    	fly:population ?pop;
    	fly:name ?city.
    ?air a ?Airport;
            fly:isLocatedInCity ?cty.
    ?st a fly:State;
    	fly:name ?state.
}group by ?state
order by desc (?nr_airp)

##########

6. The carriers with a total delay time over all the flights in minutes ordered by most delay:

########

prefix fly: <http://www.semanticweb.org/nele/ontologies/2024/10/flydata/>

select ?Carrier (SUM(?delay) as ?tot_delay) where {
    ?Car a fly:Carrier;
    	fly:name ?Carrier.
    ?flight a fly:Flight;
    	fly:isOperatedBy ?Car;
    	fly:ActualArrivalDelayTime ?delay.
} group by ?Carrier
order by desc (?tot_delay )
